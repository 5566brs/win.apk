// jni_bind.h -- binding guest native methods into HotSpot.
//
// HotSpot calls a native method with the Microsoft x64 convention and its own
// JNIEnv*. A guest native expects System V and the guest JNIEnv*. Every guest
// function HotSpot ends up calling therefore has to be replaced by a thunk
// (make_jni_native_thunk) built from the method's signature. A guest native
// reaches HotSpot in one of two ways, and both are covered here:
//
//   * Explicitly, through the guest's RegisterNatives. The guest table's
//     RegisterNatives slot (guest_register_natives) wraps each function pointer
//     before calling HotSpot's. The signature is right there in the
//     JNINativeMethod entry.
//
//   * By name: HotSpot finds Java_pkg_Class_method in a loaded library and
//     binds it lazily. Only the JVMTI NativeMethodBind event sees that address
//     together with its jmethodID, so the hook installed by
//     install_native_method_bind() swaps the guest address for a thunk there.
//     Upstream does the same on the Mac (macapk_NativeMethodBind in
//     bionic_shim.cpp). Addresses that are not guest code, including the
//     thunks RegisterNatives already installed, are left alone.
//
// Thunks are cached per (function, signature), so a library that registers
// the same natives again does not grow the thunk pool.
